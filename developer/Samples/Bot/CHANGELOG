Version History:
2.4.8   House Keeping
            1.) Removed dead links from the admin area and obsolete information pages
            2.) Merge pull requests including topic upload fix and an expansion to the make_like_pattern()


2.4.7   Security fixes
            1.) Added XSS and CSRF attack prevention to the code-base
                **Please note that this bug fix affects the config file, so will require a reinstall of the script**

2.4.6   Bug fixes, refined the admin login routines
            1.) Added code to the install script that detects the current session path, creating a new,
                uniquely named folder for the session files if one does not currently exist.
            2.) Fixed a bug with the Search/Edit AIML admin page that prevented any AIML categories from
                being displayed due to the wrong session variables being loaded.
            3.) Fixed a bug with the RSS feed display where garbage was sometimes displayed if the forum
                pages were down.
            4.) Fixed another bug with the RSS feed display where the admin script would time out if the
                forum pages were not responding.
            5.) Cleaned up some of the code where needed, standardizing the remaining PHP comment headers
                to make them all the same.
            6.) Added getbots.php to the project, which returns a JSON encoded array of ID/name pairs for
                all active chatbots, enabling botmasters to build selectboxes or radio button groups of
                chatbots. No more hard-coding bot IDs or bot names! there is a new example GUI in the
                jQuery folder (multibot_gui_with_chatlog.php) that can be used to learn how to implement
                this wih a selectbox in an AJAX driven chatbot interface page.

2.4.5   Relocated the session save path
            1.) Moved the session save path from the server default to a new folder. this increases
                security for those on shared hosts, and ensures that there are no permissions problems
                (or problems with the session save path not being set in the PHP config) for those who
                have been experiencing login problems due to sessions not being saved.

2.4.4   Multiple bug fixes, consolidated SELECT type DB queries into calls to teo functions
            1.) Fixed a bug in the core code that allowed fatal errors to be generated if the variable
                bot_id is empty or not set
            2.) Fixed a bug in the new Search/Edit AIML admin page that caused only the default chatbot's
                AIML to be displayed, rather than the currently selected chatbot.
            3.) Created 2 new PDO query functions (db_fetch() and db_fetchAll()) to handle retrieving all
                SELECT type queries, resulting in fewer lines of code to the tune of over 150
            4.) Fixed a security bug where users could directly access certain admin pages without actually
                being logged in.
            5.) Changed the download admin page to enable downloading multiple files as a zip arcvhive.

2.4.3   Multiple bug fixes, started adding internal documentation with descriptions
            1.) Fixed a bug in the XML GUI that was creating fatal errors when called from the admin page
            2.) Fixed bugs in the functions that parse SRAI, SR and CONDITION tags
            3.) Corrected a bug where certain admin pages didn't display if a new chatbot was created but not saved.
            4.) Began the process of adding internal documentation to the script, which will allow for later
                automatic generation of external documentation.
            5.) Refactored and/or removed some duplicate functions within the admin pages, to avoid conflicts
                with the generation of the above mentioned external documentation.

2.4.2   Added Local AIML Validation and SRAI Lookup Admin
            1.) Added a "local" AIML validator script, specifically designed to validate
                AIML files for Program O and Pandorabots.
            2.) Added a new page to the admin to work with the new SRAI lookup table. For
                now, the page only fills the lookup table with direct matches to existing
                SRAI calls within the AIML table, but soon it will also include functionality
                for searching the lookup table, finding "indirect match" patterns, and the
                ability to edit the templates for matched SRAI calls.
            3.) Several minor bug fixes, including one that limited the number of characters
                that the admin user name could have (without any warning of the limit). The
                new limit is 255 characters, instead of the previous 10.

2.4.1   Complete refactor for PDO support, added SRAI lookup
            1.) Refactored the code that deals with DB access to completely remove the
                last of the mysql_* functions, including "fallback support".
            2.) Added an additional table to the database to handle looking up previously
                used calls to <srai> tags. This will improve performance in the future,
                in that if an <srai> tag is stored in the lookup table, the script doesn't
                have to run through the entire AIML table to find it. If a suitable srai
                category is found that isn't already in the lookup table, it's added for
                future use. While the table is being added now, the feature is not yet
                enabled. We'll be enabling it in the near future, once further testing is
                completed.

2.4.0   Conditional PDO support added, major bug fixes
            1.) Added PDO support for PHP versions that support it (and have it enabled),
                with a fallback to the original MySQL functions if no PDO support is detected
            2.) Finally found the problem with template-side <that> tags not being displayed
                correctly. Special thanks to Tom (AKA Slow Putzo) for the assist with this!
            3.) Also fixed the long-standing bug with pattern-side <that> tags not being
                scored and chosen correctly. Once again, Thanks Tom! :D
            4.) Removed the DB stats page from the admin. It was more or less a failed
                experiment, and really needed to be removed.
            5.) Also removed the scripts to upgrade from version 2.0 to 2.3 - If you have any
                version of Program O that's older than 2.3.1, you need to do a fresh install
                and more or less start from scratch. Sorry, but that's just the way it is.
            6.) Other miscellaneous, minor bug fixes, mainly dealing with unnecessary error
                log entries.

2.3.1   Bug fixes, repaired missing table columns
            1.) Corrected a bug in the function parse_learn_tag that prevented new data from being
                inserted into the aiml_userdefined table
            2.) Added a column in the aiml_userdefined table that was missing, which was also
                preventing new data from being added.

2.3.0   Minor DB refactor, in preparation for version 2.5
            1.) removed the last of the PHP code columns from the database
            2.) added an unknown_user field to the bots table, allowing per-bot settings for what the
                will call someone they don't know
            3.) Altered the chatbot general config page in the admin to reflect the above changes
            4.) added a bot_id field and dropped a user_id field in the unknown_inputs table
            5.) dropped the user_id field from the undefined_defaults table, as it was not used
            6.) added a "memory bailout" feature to the function that returns potential AIML categories
                to prevent memory overflow errors
            7.) other miscellaneous minor bug fixes

2.2.2   Bug Fixes/versioning refactor
            1.) Fixed a bug that prevented proper implementation of template-side <that> tags
            2.) updated and corrected the script version in all files that contain version information
            3.) implemented functionality that sets the scripts internal version based on the contents
                of version.txt, rather than hard-coding it

2.2.1   Major bug fixes
            1.) Fixed a bug that was mangling Unicode characters while removing punctuation
            2.) Fixed a bug where the chatbot's debug level wasn't being used
            3.) re-wrote several functions to be more efficient


2.2.0   Foreign Langague Support
            1.) Program O now support foreign languages! YEEHAAAA
            2.) Tested against, Russian, Arabic, Turkish, French, Thai, Greek, Chinese
            3.) Converted all character coding both internal and external to UTF-8
            4.) Added the correct XML header to the display conversation functions for xml requests
            5.) Updated the XML example gui to use simpleXML to send requests to the bot


2.1.5   Bug fixes/merge to "Master" branch
            1.) Corrected a bug that improperly ordered the collections of words gathered in <pattern> and <that> tags
            2.) Corrected multiple minor bugs in the Download script that affected the use of said downloaded AIML
                files with Pandorabots.
            3.) Adjusted the function that checks GitHub for the current version of the script, based on changes they
                made to their API. Also added some error handling, in case GitHub can't be reached.
            4.) Modified some of the debugging output descriptors to avoid unnecessary and potentially confusing
                message duplication.
            5.) Corrected a bug in the main SQL query that caused certain valid AIML categories that use the <that> tag
                to be missed in the main search.
            6.) Added 'experimental' support for Pandorabots style <date> tags, adding functionality for both LOCALE
                and TIMEZONE attributes (support for these attributes was mentioned previously, but not added at that
                time).
            7.) Other minor cosmetic changes and typo corrections that didn't affect functionality.

2.1.4   Bug fixes & minor styling/feature changes
            1.) Fixed several bugs that arose from the database refactor.
            2.) Fixed the long-standing bug that caused the script to create a new user
                instead of just updating the current user when they typed in the phrase
                "clear properties".
            3.) Fixed bugs in both the word censor and spell checker addons that prevented
                botmasters from making changes to the DB.
            4.) Updated the spell checker addon to allow botmasters to enable/disable
                spell checking by editing the config file. In time, this will expand to
                the ability to enable or disable the addon per bot (future plans).
            5.) Changed the styling of the admin pages to include visible cues for BBCode
                [code] blocks from the Program O Support Forums, when viewing posts from
                the Support tab of the admin pages.

2.1.3   Added the last of the AIML tag functions/Refactored the DB/Multiple Bug Fixes
            1.) Added functions for the remaining AIML tags:
                    <thatstar>
                    <topicstar>
                    <gossip>
            2.) Refactored the database, standardizing field names across all of the tables.
            3.) Refactored the admin pages, replacing $_GET, $_POST and $_REQUEST with input
                filtering functions.
            4.) Fixed several minor bugs that were discovered during the database refactoring
                process.
            5.) Re-designed the AIML tag functions, consolidating duplicate code into a single
                function. this cut more than 70 lines of code from the script while retaining
                exactly the same functionality and performance.
            6.) Created an experimental config file editor to the admin folder, to allow
                botmasters to edit the file directly. For now, the script doesn't actually
                change the config file, but that functionality will be added in the coming
                weeks.
            7.) Updated and modified the automatic upgrade script to incorporate all of the
                above listed changes.

2.1.2   Added more AIML tag functions/Script Streamlining
            1.) Added functions for the following AIML tags:
                   <condition>
                   <system>
                   <learn>
            2.) I went through the entire script, looking for and deleting "orphaned" functions
                and streamlining code wherever possible.

2.1.1   Added functions for some AIML tags
            1.) Added functions for the following AIML tags:
                    <gender>
                    <person>
                    <person2>

2.1.0   Major revision change / Bug fixes
            1.) Altered the way that client properties are handled, by storing them in a table
                in the DB, rather than keeping them in an element of the conversation array.
            2.) Removed the AIML to PHP code functions, replacing it with an XML parser to
                both improve performance and to address several bugs that arose from trying to
                evaluate faulty PHP code strings.
            3.) removed the function get_convo_var, replacing calls to that function with direct
                queries to the conversation array.
            4.) Corrected several minor bugs that were preventing proper use/setting of some variables
        Please note that at this point, several functions still need to be written to parse certain AIML
        tags. The file TODO lists all of the tags that are still not handled.

2.0.9   Feature Update
            1.) Added a function to the admin page to poll GitHub for the current release version, and notify
                the botmaster if a new version is available, providing a link to the latest version.

2.0.8   Performed the following upgrades/fixes:
            1.) Added version information to the admin page. so that botmasters can see at a glance which version
                they're using. This is a prelude to a new "version check" feature that I'm working on.
            2.) Corrected a bug where changing the bot's default page format wasn't being reflected in the config
                file. PLEASE NOTE that if you have several chatbots, this will affect ALL of them, but if that's
                the case, you shouldn't be relying on the default chatbot page anyway.

2.0.7   Two major changes, this time:
            1.) Removed some settings from the install script that had been causing new chatbots to
              fail to respond. These settings are still available in the admin pages, but during installation
              are given default values.
            2.) Added support for uploading ZIP file archives of AIML files, to make the process of adding
              AIML files less faster and less tedious. the size limit for uploading files is still 2MB,
              but a 2MB ZIP file can hold a LOT of AIML files.

2.0.6   Performed the following upgrades/fixes:
            1.) Corrected typographical errors in several files, both in the admin pages, and in the config files.
            2.) Consolidated error logging, adding a /logs/ folder to the base directory. Error logs are
              also named for the pages where the errors occur. (e.g. admin.error.log for the admin pages,
              install.error.log, etc.)
            3.) Updated the addon checkForBan, activating it, and adding functionality to add banned users
              to the list of banned IP addresses. It's still up to the botmaster to implement banning in
              their AIML files. To ban a user, insert the following into the apropriate AIML template:
              <ban><get name="ip_address" /></ban>
          For further assistance, please check out the Program O Support Forums.

2.0.5   Bug fixes
            1.) Fixed a bug where uploaded AIML files were not being added to the DB, even if they passed validation.
            2.) Added the variable $default_charset to allow character encoding other than UTF-8 for both AIML files
                and chatbot pages.
            3.) Added experimental support for international characters. This is far from it's "final" implementation,
                but we hope that it's a start.

2.0.4   Fixed a bug in the debugging functions that caused empty debugging files to be created on non-Windows systems

2.0.3   Added simple AIML validation to the upload script, and restyled the admin pages accordingly

2.0.2   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.1   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.0   Initial Release
