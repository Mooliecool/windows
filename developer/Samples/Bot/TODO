  1.) Add functionality for botmasters to see what inputs triggered the default
      response category, so that they may be able to more easily determine what
      AIML categories need to be added.

  2.) Add a page to the admin script that helps botmasters create new AIML categories
      based on the functionality mentioned in item 1, above.

  3.) Add a page to the admin script that allows botmasters to edit the config file
      directly.

  4.) Add row count for AIML files in the admin/download page
      "select count(*) from aiml where filename = '$fileName'"

  5.) Create/modify some bot-level configurable default values so that botmasters can use their own
      values, based on their chatbot's "native language".

  6.) Finish the parse_eval_tag() function.
