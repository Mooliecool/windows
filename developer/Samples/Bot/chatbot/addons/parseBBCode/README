***************************************/

This addon for Program O allows both the bot and the user (experimentally) to use BBCode style tags,
just like in most popular forums. and chatrooms.

Usage:

Formatting:
[b]bold[/b]             - bold text
[i]italic[/i]           - italicized text
[u]underline[/u]        - underlined text
[s]strikethrough[/s]    - strikethrough text

Color:
There are two means for "describing" the color in color tags:
1.) [color=red]Red Text[/color]     - named color
2.) [color=#FFFFFF]White Text[/color]   - CSS style Hex color number

This addon uses only the color names stored in colors.dat. You can add any named color you wish by
adding the color name, followed by a comma and space, then it's CSS "Hex Triplet" equivilent, all as
one line, to the end of the file colors.dat. For example:

Taupe, #483C32
HunterGreen, #355E3B

Note that any color names that normally have spaces MUST use Camelized Text, as seen in example #2,
above. There are 147 color entries in the default version of colors.dat - these colors are the only
ones that are supported in every current web browser, so use care when adding a named color, as it
may not turn out exactly the way you intend. It won't hurt anything, but some browsers may display a
different color than you intend.


Links & Images:
Your bot can display images without having to resort to HTML IMG tags, in the following ways:

Images:
[img]http://example.com/path/to/your/image[/img]

Links:
[url]http://example.com/[/url] - Displays a link with the link text being the same as the web address.
[url=http://example.com/]my page[/url] - Displays a link with the text as "my page".
[link]http://example.com/[/link] - Displays a link with the link text being the same as the web address.
[link=http://example.com/]my page[/link] - Displays a link with the text as "my page".


Lastly:
The BBCode input parser is currently experimental in nature, and is quite likely to "break" the user's input
before it goes to the interpreter, so it's use is NOT recommended at this time. Plans to add a function to
strip the BBCode tags from the user's input are in the works, but have not been designed yet.
