This addon for Program O spell checks the users inputs before they are sent to the
database to look for an aiml match. The spell checker first breaks the input into
individual words, then checks each word against a list of (almost) 1,000 of the most
common English words. If the word is found in that list, it's left unchanged. If the
word is not a "common" word, it then checks the database, and if found, the misspelling
is replaced with the coorrectly spelled word.

The default installation of this addon comes with a corrections database of around
100 missspelled words and their corrections. You can add to the database from the admin
control panel, under "Spell Check".

The spell checker addon is enabled by default. To disable the spell checker
addon, open the config file (config/global_config.php) and look for the following line
of code:

    define('USE_SPELL_CHECKER', true);

and change the word 'true' to 'false', then save the changes. To enable the addon once it
has been disabled, simply reverse the process. :)
