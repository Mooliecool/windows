<h1>Release Notes</h1></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, arial" SIZE=2>
<P>Island Hopper is Case-Insensitive - It will not run properly against a SQL Server database which has its sort order set to case-sensitive.  If you wish to run against case-sensitive SQL Server, modifications will need to be made to data access code in the COM components so that all queries to the database use table and field names of the proper case.</P>
<P>Installing Sample A and Sample C on the same machine is not supported.
Make sure you completely uninstall one level of the sample before installing another.</P>
<P>If you experience intermittent access violations that refer to OLEChannelWnd:mtx.exe, they
are the result of an operating system error.
You can download a patch for this error at
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up/</P>
<P>The Island Hopper database includes a record for a sample customer.
You can use this customer when you are exploring the Island Hopper sample.
The e-mail address for the sample customer is "someone@microsoft.com" and
the password is "microsoft".</P>
<h1>Installing and Configuring Island Hopper News Level C</h1>
</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, arial" SIZE=2>
<p>This topic describes the prerequisites and installation instructions for level C of the Island Hopper News sample. If you only want to take a quick look at the source code, run source.exe to unzip source files.</p>
<p>
The Island Hopper News Sample is shipped on the companion CD to "Designing Component Based Applications." You can install the samples directly from the CD.</p>
</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Verdana, arial">
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, arial" SIZE=2>
<p>Level C of the Island Hopper News sample requires at least one machine for installation. Machines should meet the minimum system requirements for Visual Studio. See System Requirements online in MSDN Library Visual Studio 6.0 for complete information on machine requirements. You can install level C on as many as four different machines, each with a different role. You can think of these roles as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Developer machine -- the machine used to work with the source code.<br><br></li>
<li>
Client machine -- the machine where the Windows and Web clients for the sample are installed.<br><br></li>
<li>
Server machine -- the machine where the components that contain the business rules are deployed, as well as the ASP pages that make up the Web client.<br><br></li>
<li>
Database machine -- the machine where the sample application's database is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can use a different machine for each role, or you can choose to combine some roles onto one machine. Using one high-powered machine for all four roles also works. A separate setup program is included for each role. Run the setup programs on the machines you have chosen for each role. If you want to use one machine for all four roles, run all four setup programs on that machine.</p>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, arial" SIZE=2>
<p>
<b>Important:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are installing all of the sample on the same machine, make sure you complete the following procedures in the order in which they appear. Make sure you run the server setup program after the client and source code setup programs.</p>
<p>
The setup programs are self-extracting .zip files. Double-clicking any setup program first uncompresses the files required for the setup program, then launches the setup program automatically.</p>
<p>
These instructions assume that you are installing the sample directly from the companion CD. If you have already copied the sample files to your local drive, substitute the correct location on your local drive for each location mentioned in the steps below.</p>

<h2>Uninstallation Instructions</h2>
</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, arial" SIZE=2>
<p>
The client, source code, and server setup programs of the Island Hopper News sample each include an associated uninstall program. There is no uninstall program for the database. If you are using a single machine for more than one role, you need to execute the uninstall programs in the reverse order from the installs. For example, you might run the uninstall programs in the following order:
<ol>
<li>
Server uninstall<br><br></li>
<li>
Source code uninstall<br><br></li>
<li>
Client uninstall</li>
</ol>
<P>If you are using more than one machine for the sample, you need to execute uninstall programs on each machine. Additionally, if you have installed the clients or the source code on a machine different from the server machine, you will need to uninstall additional components on the client and developer machines.</P>
<P>The following procedures describe how to uninstall the Island Hopper News sample from a single machine and from multiple machines.</P>

<h3>Server_Components</h3>
<ol>
<li>IbusCustomer, IdbCustomer, IdbCustomerPassword 
   <ul>
   <li>remove explicit path to msado15.dll from IDL 
     file. not everyone has their O/S on the C drive. 
     devs can add the ado directory to their include 
     and lib paths in the VC IDE. 
   <li>change /Zl option in debug settings to /Zi for 
     compatibility with VC5.
   </ul>
<li>bus_CustomerC
   <ul>
   <li>change errors that use vbObjectError to use ERROR_NUMBER,
     since it was defined as the generic server component error
     constant.
   <li>change Add function to query for IbusCustomerChange, rather
     than creating a whole new object. correct comment.
   <li>change GetByEmail function to query for IbusCustomerLookup, rather
     than creating a whole new object. correct comment.
   <li>change calls to SetErrSource so they consistently use the
     name of the method making the call.
   </ul>
<li>bus_InvoiceC
   <ul>
   <li>change IbusInvoice interface to expose GetDetailByID method
     which is needed by VBClient. Adjust typelib version to 1.1
     and change IID for interface so you can tell the difference.
     (instead of having VBClient bypass the bus object...)
   <li>remove #import msado15.dll statement from bus_Invoice.cpp, since
     it is imported in stdafx.h
   <li>modify #import statement for IdbCustomer in bus_Invoice.cpp
     to point to tlb since it is in same directory regardless of 
     which configuration you build.
   <li>remove unused pObjDB_CustomerLookup declaration from 
     Cbus_Invoice::AddHeader
   <li>add missing call to UpdateBalance in Cbus_Invoice::AddHeader
   <li>add call to LocalFree(pErrMsg) in error handlers for
     Cbus_Invoice::AddHeader, AddDetail, GetByID, GetByCustID
   <li>remove unnecessary rsTemp from Cbus_Invoice::GetByID &
     fix up call to dbInvoice GetByID.
   <li>add error return check followed call to dbInvoice GetByID
     in Cbus_Invoice::GetByID
   <li>remove unnecessary rsTemp from Cbus_Invoice::GetByCustID &
     fix up call to dbInvoice GetByCustID.
   <li>remove explicit path to msado15.dll from IDL file. 
   <li>change /Zl option in debug settings to /Zi for 
     compatibility with VC5.
   </ul>
<li>bus_PaymentC
   <ul>
   <li>add missing call to GetObjectContext.SetComplete in GetByCustID.
   </ul>
<li>db_CategoryC
   <ul>
   <li>remove unnecessary statement 'Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset' in
     Add, GetByID, GetByName, GetBySearchString functions
   </ul>
<li>db_CustomerC
   <ul>
   <li>change calls to SetErrSource so they consistently use the
     name of the method making the call.
   </ul>
<li>db_CustomerPasswordC
   <ul>
   <li>ICustomerPasswordLookup_GetByID should really be changed
     to be a Private function, so that it is really implemented 
     as part of ICustomerPasswordLookup not the default interface. 
     (only called from bus_CustomerC, so this should not be a 
     problem) however this breaks binary compatibility with 
     published db_CustomerPasswordC.
   <li>change GetByID to use ADODB.Recordset, not ADOR.Recordset, for
     consistency.
   <li>change calls to SetErrSource so they consistently use the
     name of the method making the call.
   </ul>
<li>db_PaymentC
   <ul>
   <li>remove #import msado15.dll in db_Payment.cpp, since it is 
     imported in stdafx.h
   <li>remove explicit path to msado15.dll from IDL file.
   <li>modify to use smart pointer CreateInstance, for cleaner code.
   <li>remove extra AddRef call in GetByCustID
   <li>change /Zl option in debug settings to /Zi for 
     compatibility with VC5.
   </ul>
<li>db_ProductC
   <ul>
   <li>remove unnecessary statement 'Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset' in
     GetUnitPrice function
   <li>remove unnecessary creation of empty recordsets in GetByID,
     ListByDesc
   </ul>
<li>util_TakeANumber
   <ul>
   <li>change GetANumber to create the property group with LockMethod,
     rather than LockSetGet
   <li>correct comments about TakeANumberUpdate
   </ul>
<li>util_WordCount
   <ul>
   <li>change /Zl option in debug settings to /Zi for 
     compatibility with VC5.
   <li>change project settings to build DLLs in common DLLs directory.
   </ul>
