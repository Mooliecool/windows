<h2>Island Hopper News Sample</h2>

<hr>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 sample application, Island Hopper News, illustrates how
you can design and structure applications using the Microsoft platform and the Visual
Studio suite.</p>

<p><i>Island Hopper News</i> is a fictitious online newspaper, designed to be published on
the World Wide Web. It features local, national, and international news; local sports; and
local classified ads. Only part of the Island Hopper News application is implemented as
the Visual Studio 6.0 sample application: the classified ad section. Not all the
functionality you might want or expect is present. The sample was implemented this way to
provide the best example for you &#151; the parts from which you can extrapolate to build
an application that suits your own needs and purposes.</p>

<p>The sample is an enterprise-scale version of the application, suitable for the
Internet. It includes client applications, business and data access components, and
databases.</p>

<p>The Island Hopper News sample will show how to transition an internal Web application
to an external public Internet application. It illustrates how Island Hopper Publishing
(the parent company of <i>Island Hopper News</i>) moved its classified ads application to
its external Web site. It builds in the concepts of customer and invoice tracking to
support classified ads (and other parts of the company's line of business). For purposes
of the sample, only a slice of a fully developed working application is shown &#151; the
parts that comprise the classified ads function.</p>

<h4>Technologies</h4>

<p>Island Hopper News is a full-blown enterprise application that makes full use of
Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), Internet Information Server (IIS), and SQL Server. It
is a client/server application with two clients: a traditional Windows client developed
using Visual Basic, and a Web client developed with Visual InterDev. Each client serves a
different user: 

<ul type="disc">
  <li>Island Hopper Publishing company employees use the Windows client to maintain customer
    records, track invoices, and track payments.</li>
  <li>Island Hopper Publishing customers use the Web client to browse and place classified ads
    in Island Hopper News.</li>
</ul>

<p>Island Hopper News demonstrates more complex use of COM components for encapsulation of
business rules and data access. Many of the components were developed using Visual Basic;
some were developed using Visual C++.</p>

<h4>Build Notes</h4>

<p>Island Hopper is Case-Insensitive - It will not run properly against a SQL Server
database which has its sort order set to case-sensitive. If you wish to run against
case-sensitive SQL Server, modifications will need to be made to data access code in the
COM components so that all queries to the database use table and field names of the proper
case.</p>

<p>If you experience intermittent access violations that refer to OLEChannelWnd:mtx.exe,
they are the result of an operating system error. You can download a patch for this error
at
<a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up/">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up/</a>.</p>

<p>The Island Hopper database includes a record for a sample customer. You can use this
customer when you are exploring the Island Hopper sample. The e-mail address for the
sample customer is &quot;someone@microsoft.com&quot; and the password is
&quot;microsoft&quot;.</p>

<h5><big>Installing and Configuring Island Hopper News</big></h5>

<p>This topic describes the prerequisites and installation instructions for the Island
Hopper News sample. If you only want to take a quick look at the source code, run
source.exe to unzip source files.</p>

<p>The Island Hopper News Sample files are copied to
mssdk\samples\com\Application_Samples\Island_Hopper if you accept the default installation
location.</p>

<h5><big>Prerequisites</big></h5>

<p>The Island Hopper News sample requires at least one machine for installation. Machines
should meet the minimum system requirements for Visual Studio. See System Requirements
online in MSDN Library Visual Studio 6.0 for complete information on machine requirements.
You can install Island Hopper News on as many as four different machines, each with a
different role. You can think of these roles as follows: 

<ul>
  <li>Developer machine -- the machine used to work with the source code.</li>
  <li>Client machine -- the machine where the Windows and Web clients for the sample are
    installed.</li>
  <li>Server machine -- the machine where the components that contain the business rules are
    deployed, as well as the ASP pages that make up the Web client.</li>
  <li>Database machine -- the machine where the sample application's database is installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use a different machine for each role, or you can choose to combine some roles
onto one machine. Using one high-powered machine for all four roles also works. A separate
setup program is included for each role. Run the setup programs on the machines you have
chosen for each role. If you want to use one machine for all four roles, run all four
setup programs on that machine.</p>

<h5><big>Software Requirements</big></h5>

<p>Before installing Island Hopper News, you must have installed the following software:</p>

<table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><b>Client Machine</b></td>
    <td><b>Developer Machine</b></td>
    <td><b>Server Machine</b></td>
    <td><b>Database Machine</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher</td>
    <td>Visual Studio 6.0, Enterprise Edition<p>NT Option Pack, version 4.0</td>
    <td>NT Option Pack version 4.0</td>
    <td>Microsoft SQL Server 6.5</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h5><br>
<big>Other Information</big></h5>

<p>Gather the following information before you begin the installation process. The setup
programs will prompt you for this information. 

<ul>
  <li>The name of your IIS/MTS server</li>
  <li>A server location in which to install the web content of the sample</li>
  <li>The name of the database machine</li>
  <li>Your SQL Server user ID and password</li>
</ul>

<h5><big>Installation Instructions</big></h5>

<p><b>Important:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are installing all of the sample on the same
machine, make sure you complete the following procedures in the order in which they
appear. Make sure you run the server setup program after the client and source code setup
programs.</p>

<p>The setup programs are self-extracting .zip files. Double-clicking any setup program
first uncompresses the files required for the setup program, then launches the setup
program automatically.</p>

<p>These instructions assume that you are installing the sample from your local drive.</p>

<h5><big>Uninstallation Instructions</big></h5>

<p>The client, source code, and server setup programs of the Island Hopper News sample
each include an associated uninstall program. There is no uninstall program for the
database. If you are using a single machine for more than one role, you need to execute
the uninstall programs in the reverse order from the installs. For example, you might run
the uninstall programs in the following order: 

<ol>
  <li>Server uninstall</li>
  <li>Source code uninstall</li>
  <li>Client uninstall</li>
  <li>If you are using more than one machine for the sample, you need to execute uninstall
    programs on each machine. Additionally, if you have installed the clients or the source
    code on a machine different from the server machine, you will need to uninstall additional
    components on the client and developer machines.</li>
</ol>
