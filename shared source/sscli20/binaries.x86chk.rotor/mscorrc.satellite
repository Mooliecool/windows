This is likely because the managed PInvoke " L"signature does not match the unmanaged target signature. Check that the calling convention and " L"parameters of the PInvoke signature match the target unmanaged signature.The '%1$s' configuration file is invalid.A callback was made on a garbage collected delegate of type '%1$s'. This may cause application " L"crashes, corruption and data loss. " L"When passing delegates to unmanaged code, they must be kept alive by the " L"managed application until it is guaranteed that they will never be called.An attempt was made to change the apartment state of the thread to %1$s, " L"but it has already been set to %2$s. When creating a new thread the apartment state should" L"be set before the thread is started. For the main thread of the application, the apartment" L"state can be set by specifying either [STAThreadAttribute] or [MTAThreadAttribute] on the" L"main method of the application. " L"If the application really needs to attempt to set the apartment state on a running thread, " L"Thread.TrySetApartmentState should be used and the return value should be consulted to determine " L"if the operation was successful. Note that Thread.TrySetApartmentState will not fire the " L"InvalidApartmentStateChange MDA.The current thread used to have an apartment state of %1$s, but the application has CoUnitialized " L"this thread and it is now %2$s. This may cause calls on RuntimeCallableWrappers " L"representing some COM components to fail and may also cause COM component that are " L"not multi-threaded to be accessed from multiple threads at the same time which can cause " L"corruption or data loss.Attempting managed execution inside OS Loader lock. Do not " L"attempt to run managed code inside a DllMain or image initialization function since doing " L"so can cause the application to hang.An exception was caught but handled while releasing a COM interface pointer " L"through Marshal.Release, Marshal.ReleaseComObject or implicitly after the corresponding " L"RuntimeCallableWrapper was garbage collected. This is the result of a user " L"refcount error or other problem with a COM object's Release. Make sure " L"refcounts are managed properly. While these types of exceptions are caught by the CLR, " L"they can still lead to corruption and data loss so if possible the issue causing the exception " L"should be addressedAn invalid VARIANT was detected during a conversion from an unmanaged VARIANT " L"to a managed object. Passing invalid VARIANTs to the CLR can cause unexpected exceptions, " L"corruption or data loss.The call to QI for interface '%1$s' with IID '%2$s' failed with HRESULT 0x%3$s (%4$s). " L"One likely reason this failed is that the object does not have a proxy/stub dll properly registered.Context 0x%1$x is disconnected.  No proxy will be used to service the request on the COM " L"component. This may cause corruption or data loss. To avoid this problem, please ensure " L"that all contexts/apartments stay alive until the application is completely done with the " L"RuntimeCallableWrappers that represent COM components that live inside them.Context 0x%1$x' is disconnected.  Releasing the interfaces from the current context (context 0x%2$x)." L"This may cause corruption or data loss. " L"To avoid this problem, please ensure that all contexts/apartments stay alive until the application" L"is completely done with the RuntimeCallableWrappers that represent COM components that live" L"inside them.A non marshalable COM component is being used from a different apartment/context then the " L"one where it first entered the CLR. Since the component is non marshalable, it will be called directly " L"from the current apartment/context. This may cause corruption or data loss if the component does " L"not support being accessed from multiple threads at once. This is most likely caused by a faulty " L"IMarshal implementation on the part of the COM component.An invalid IUnknown* was detected during a conversion from a COM component " L"to a managed object. Passing invalid IUnknown pointers to the CLR can cause unexpected " L"exceptions, corruption or data loss.Marshaling parameter with index %1$i and name '%2$s' from '%3$s' to '%4$s'Invalid function pointer 0x%1$x was passed into the runtime to be converted to a delegate. " L"Passing in invalid function pointers to be converted to delegates can cause crashes, " L"corruption or data loss. An early bound call (vtable call) was made on the following member of an auto " L"dispatch class interface: '%1$s'. Early bound calls on members of auto dispatch " L"class interfaces are not allowed. Please consider using an explicit interface " L"as the default interface for the type. If a class interface must be " L"called early bound, change it to auto dual. This can be accomplished " L"by marking the class with the following attribute, located in the " L"System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace: " L"[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)] Method '%1$s', while executing within a constrained execution region, makes a call " L"at IL offset 0x%2$04X to '%3$s', which does not have a sufficiently strong reliability " L"contract and might cause non-deterministic results.Method '%1$s', while executing within a constrained execution region, makes a call " L"at IL offset 0x%2$04X to '%3$s', which is virtual and cannot be prepared automatically " L"at compile time. The caller must ensure this method is prepared explicitly at " L"runtime before entering the constrained execution region.Method '%1$s', which contains at least one constrained execution region, cannot be " L"prepared automatically since it has one or more unbound generic type parameters. " L"The caller must ensure this method is prepared explicitly at runtime prior to " L"execution.Method '%1$s' calls RuntimeHelpers.PrepareConstrainedRegions() at IL offset 0x%2$04X. " L"This is invalid since it does not coincide with the beginning of a try clause.The CLR marshaler encountered an error while attempting to restore the thread culture after a call " L"from unmanaged to managed where an LCID was used to specify the culture for the call. This will " L"cause the thread's culture to remain set to the one associated with the LCID. The cause of the failure was: %1$sThe CLR marshaler encountered an error while attempting to release the reference to a SafeHandle " L"it acquired in order to marshal the SafeHandle to an unmanaged pointer during a call from managed to unmanaged. " L"This may cause the unmanaged resource the SafeHandle represents to be leaked. The cause of the failure was: %1$sThe CLR marshaler encountered an error while attempting to associate a SafeHandle with an unmanaged resource. " L"This may cause the unmanaged resource to be leaked. The cause of the failure was: %1$sAn exception was thrown from the CleanupNativeData method of a custom marshaler of type '%1$s'. " L"This may cause an unmanaged data leak and should be corrected if possible. The cause of the failure was: %1$sA SafeHandle or CriticalHandle of type '%1$s' failed to properly release the handle " L"with value 0x%2$p. This usually indicates that the handle was released incorrectly " L"via another means (such as extracting the handle using DangerousGetHandle and " L"closing it directly or building another SafeHandle around it.)Function DllMain, called with reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, returned FALSE. DLL initialization failed. " L"To ignore the DllMain return, set Registry value " L"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework\IgnoreDllMainReturn to 1Reflection has created a memberInfo cache.User code running on thread %1$i has attempted to abort thread %2$i. This may result in a corrupt state " L"or resource leaks if the thread being aborted was in the middle of an operation that modifies global " L"state or uses native resources. Aborting threads other than the currently running thread is strongly " L"discouraged.The assembly named '%1$s' was loaded from '%2$s' using the LoadFrom context. The use of this " L"context can result in unexpected behavior for serialization, casting and dependency resolution. " L"In almost all cases, it is recommended that the LoadFrom context be avoided. This can be done " L"by installing assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache or in the ApplicationBase directory and " L"using Assembly.Load when explicitly loading assemblies.The CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x%1$x to COM context 0x%2$x for 60 seconds. " L"The thread that owns the destination context/apartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait " L"or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows messages. " L"This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to " L"the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time. " L"To avoid this problem, all single threaded apartment (STA) threads should use pumping wait " L"primitives (such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles) and routinely pump messages during long running operations.An attempt has been made to free an RCW that is in use.  The RCW is in use on the active thread or " L"another thread.  Attempting to free an in-use RCW can cause corruption or data loss.A UTC DateTime is being converted to text in a format that is only correct for local times. " L"This can happen when calling DateTime.ToString using the 'z' format specifier, which will " L"include a local time zone offset in the output. In that case, either use the 'Z' format specifier, " L"which designates a UTC time, or use the 'o' format string, which is the recommended way to persist " L"a DateTime in text. This can also occur when passing a DateTime to be serialized by " L"XmlConvert or DataSet. If using XmlConvert.ToString, pass in " L"XmlDateTimeSerializationMode.RoundtripKind to serialize correctly. If using DataSet, set the " L"DateTimeMode on the DataColumn object to DataSetDateTime.Utc. The following error occurred while determining how to marshal the parameters of member '%1$s' of type '%2$s': " L"%3$s This is most likely due to an incompatible MarshalAs attribute on one of the parameters. A COM client has called managed method '%1$s' on type '%2$s'. This method does not have an HRESULT return type and " L"an exception was thrown that was not handled. The exception contains the following message: %3$s. " L"This exception will be caught and zero will be returned to the COM caller if the method's return " L"type is not void.Attempting to call into managed code without transitioning out first.  Do not " L"attempt to run managed code inside low-level native extensibility points, such as the vectored " L"exception handler, since doing so can cause corruption and data loss.A QueryInterface call was made requesting the class interface of COM visible managed class '%1$s'. " L"However since this class derives from non COM visible class '%2$s', the QueryInterface call will fail. " L"This is done to prevent the non COM visible base class from being constrained by the COM versioning " L"rules.A QueryInterface call was made requesting the default IDispatch interface of COM visible managed " L"class '%1$s'. However since this class does not have an explicit default interface and derives from non " L"COM visible class '%2$s', the QueryInterface call will fail. This is done to prevent the non COM " L"visible base class from being constrained by the COM versioning rules.The assembly with display name '%1$s' loaded from code base '%2$s' failed to load " L"in the '%3$s' binding context of the AppDomain with ID %4$d. The cause of the failure was: %5$sAn attempt was made to retrieve a GCHandle from an invalid IntPtr cookie (0x%1$x). " L"The cookie was most likely invalid because the cookie does not represent a GCHandle, " L"the GCHandle has already been freed, " L"the retrieval was attempted in the wrong AppDomain, " L"or the GCHandle was marshaled to native code as a GCHandle but passed back into " L"managed code as an IntPtr where a cast was attempted. " L"Attempting to use an invalid pointer to reclaim a GC handle can cause unexpected exceptions, crashes, " L"corruption or data loss. An exception was caught but handled while releasing a COM interface pointer " L"through Marshal.Release or Marshal.ReleaseComObject or implicitly after the corresponding " L"RuntimeCallableWrapper was garbage collected. This is the result of a user " L"refcount error or other problem with a COM object's Release. Make sure " L"refcounts are managed properly.  The COM interface pointer's original vtable " L"pointer was 0x%1$x. While these types of exceptions are caught by the CLR, " L"they can still lead to corruption and data loss so if possible the issue causing the exception " L"should be addressedThe first PInvoke call to export '%1$s' in module '%2$s' has been made.The runtime has encountered a fatal error. The address of the error was at 0x%1$08x, on thread 0x%2$x. " L"The error code is 0x%3$08x. This error may be a bug in the CLR or in the unsafe " L"or non-verifiable portions of user code. Common sources of this bug include user marshaling errors " L"for COM-interop or PInvoke, which may corrupt the stack.User code has attempted to call the following API: '%1$s'. This may result in a deadlock in the process.An overlapped pointer (0x%1$p) that was not allocated on the GC heap was passed via PInvoke to " L"the Win32 function '%2$s' in module '%3$s'. " L"If the AppDomain is shut down, this can cause heap corruption when the async I/O completes. " L"The best solution is to pass a NativeOverlapped structure retrieved from a call to " L"System.Threading.Overlapped.Pack(). If the AppDomain exits, the CLR will keep this structure " L"alive and pinned until the I/O completes.An overlapped pointer (0x%1$p) may have been freed before the I/O operation completed. " L"Freeing an overlapped pointer before the I/O operation completes will cause GC heap corruption " L"when the I/O does complete. " L"Note that this MDA may not represent an error if the overlapped operation did not start successfullyThe native component calling into the CLR through this ComCallWrapper has performed an " L"illegal cast on this IUnknown or IDispatch pointer.  The caller neglected to call QueryInterface " L"for the correct interface before making this call.A thread has entered fiber mode and therefore debugging must be stopped.The assembly loaded from code base '%1$s' failed to load in the '%2$s' binding context of the " L"AppDomain with ID %3$d.
