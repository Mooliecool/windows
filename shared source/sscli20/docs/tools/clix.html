<h1>Shared Source CLI Managed Application Launcher</h1>
<p>The Shared Source CLI (SSCLI) execution environment requires that managed 
applications be executed using the clix application launcher.&nbsp; This tool  loads the 
SSCLI execution environment which  then loads the managed application 
and starts its execution from the initial entry point. The initial  entry point is  by default 
defined as a <b>static</b> method named  <b>Main</b> in some class 
in the assembly.&nbsp; If there are multiple static classes named  <b>Main</b>, the 
entry point must be specified by using the<b> /main</b>:<i>method</i> option of the 
al.exe Assembly Linker or <b>/main</b>:<i>type</i> option of the C# compiler.</p>


<p>You must use clix.exe to execute applications under 
the SSCLI execution environment.&nbsp; If you fail to use the clix launcher on 
Microsoft Windows® and simply execute the application name, the managed 
application might execute under the .NET Framework if it is installed.</p>


<p>The clix application will be in your path if you have used env.bat to 
set your SSCLI environment variables and you have successfully built the source 
tree.</p>


<h4>Usage</h4>


<blockquote>


<PRE class="syntax"><B>clix</B> <i>managed_application [optional arguments to managed application]</i></PRE>

 
</blockquote>

 
<p>The following table describes the options available.</p>

 
<table border=1>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH width=33%>Option</TH>
<TH width=67%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%><i>managed_application</i></TD>
<TD width=67%>The file name of the managed application file you want to execute 
in the SSCLI execution environment.&nbsp; The file name must fully specify 
the path to the managed application if the application is not in the current directory.<p>The 
application must be a managed executable file which has an initial execution 
entry point as defined by the <b>/main</b>:<i>method</i> option of the Assembly Linker or the <b>/main</b>:<i>type </i>option of the C# compiler.</p>
<p>The .exe extension is inferred if it is not directly specified.<p>If no 
extension is supplied and the filename does not exist exactly as specified, clix appends &quot;.exe&quot; (lowercase) to the name specified by <i>
managed_application
</i>and attempts to load a file with that name.</TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH width=33%>Error</TH>
<TH width=67%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Out of memory</TD>
<TD width=67%>The application launcher failed to allocate sufficient memory.&nbsp; 
The application might be too large to load into memory or there might be a configuration 
problem with the execution environment.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Invalid EXE file size</TD>
<TD width=67%>The file size exceeds the file size limit of 4,294,967,295 
((DWORD)0xFFFFFFFF)</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Invalid EXE format</TD>
<TD width=67%>The specified managed application file is not an executable file. 
It is probably a text or other document or data file.</TD>
</TR>

<tr>
<TD width=33%>Invalid EXE signature</TD>
<TD width=67%>The PE image header of the .exe file contains an invalid signature 
value.</TD>
</tr>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>EXE is not Managed</TD>
<TD width=67%>The specified managed application file is not a managed 
executable file.&nbsp; It is probably an unmanaged application or library.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Failed to load execution environment from <i>filename</i>.
<p><i>Reason for error</i></TD>
<TD width=67%>The application launcher is unable to load the SSCLI 
execution environment.&nbsp; Either the environment configuration or environment 
variables are incorrect or specific required files are missing.<p>For example, 
the full error</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Failed to load execution environment from sscoree.dll. 
The specified module could not be found.</pre>
</blockquote>
indicates that the critical Shared Source CLI file, sscoree.dll, could not be found.&nbsp; 
Your build process might have failed to build the file, or the file might have been 
deleted or corrupted.&nbsp; Build again and check closely for build errors. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Could not open file <i>filename</i>.
<p><i>Reason for error</i></TD>
<TD width=67%>The specified managed application file,<i> filename, </i>could not 
be opened.&nbsp; The <i>reason for error </i>text indicates the reason 
for the error.&nbsp; For example, the reason
<blockquote>
  <pre>The system cannot find the file specified.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>indicates that the file cannot be found at the specified location.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%><p>Could not find CorExeMain in the execution environment at <i>
filename</i>. <p><i>Reason for error</i></TD>
<TD width=67%>The specified managed application file did not contain an 
execution entry point.&nbsp; It is either a managed library assembly or an 
incorrectly linked managed application assembly.</TD>
