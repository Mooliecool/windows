Description
= This test simulates multiple access to a server using multiple 
= client thread. The main function thread serves for accepting 
= connection from clients thread. For every client that connect, the 
= main thread creates a server thread, it will handle data exchange
= with that client. Client thread are created on the fly for every
= iteration of the main for loop. Every client will wait
= few seconds to get a chance to connect to the server. If a failure
= occurs with a client, the test continues and an error will be 
= triggered by a call to Fail() at the end of the main thread. This 
= rocedure insures that all allocated handle and ressources are 
= unallocated. The amount of data transfered are known by the server
= and the client. As soon as they have the expected number of bytes
= received, they will stop receiving data and start replying on the 
= the same socket.
