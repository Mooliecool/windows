Description 
= Create two threads to exercise TryEnterCriticalSection
= and EnterCriticalSection.  TryEnterCriticalSection acquires 
= and holds a CRITICAL_SECTION object.  Another call to 
= TryEnterCriticalSection is made from a different thread, at 
= this time, to establish a call to TryEnterCriticalSection
= will return immediatly and to establish 
= TryEnterCriticalSection returns the proper value when it
= attempts to lock a CRITICAL_SECTION that is already owned 
= by another thread.  The CRITICAL_SECTION object is then 
= released and held by a call to EnterCriticalSection.  A new 
= thread is invoked and attempts to acquire the held 
= CRITICAL_SECTION with a call to TryEnterCriticalSection.  
= TryEnterCriticalSection returns immediatly and returns
= with the value that states the CRITICAL_SECTION object is 
= held by another thread.  This establishes 
= TryEnterCriticalSection behaves the same way with 
= CriticalSections locked by TryEnterCriticalSection and 
= EnterCriticalSection.
