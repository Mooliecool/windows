Name = Test for DuplicateHandle
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = test11
EXE2 = childprocess
Description
= Test to ensure proper operation of the DuplicateHandle API.
= The test launches a trivial child process, then opens
= a handle to it using OpenProcess. It then duplicates that
= handle and uses it to wait for the child process to terminate,
= and then checks the exit code of the child process in order to
= verify that it was in fact a handle to the correct= process. The test tries to duplicate the handle again after
= the process has been closed, to verify that failure ensues.
