Function = DuplicateHandle
Name = Test for DuplicateHandle (GetCurrentProcess)
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = test9
Description
= Tests the PAL implementation of the DuplicateHandle function,
= with a handle from GetCurrentProcess. The test will create a 
= process, duplicate it, then using ReadProcessMemory will
= read from the memory location of the CreateProcess process
= memory and the DuplicateHandle process memory. If the 
= duplication is correct the memory will be the same for both.
