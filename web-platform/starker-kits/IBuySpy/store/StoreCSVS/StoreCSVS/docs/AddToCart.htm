            AddToCart.aspx Page
        </h1>
        <b>Description:</b> The AddToCart page adds the currently displayed product to 
        the user's shopping cart and then immediately redirects the browser to the <A href="ShoppingCart_aspx.htm">
            ShoppingCart.aspx</A> &nbsp; page.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Implementation Notes:&nbsp;</strong> The AddToCart page is invoked when 
        users click the "Add to Cart" link in the product list page (<A href="ProductsList_aspx.htm">ProductsList.aspx</A>) 
        or in a product details page (<A href="ProductDetails_aspx.htm">ProductDetails.aspx</A>). 
        The page displays no text. It simply gathers information, calls a process to 
        update the shopping cart, and then navigates to the shopping cart summary page 
        (<A href="ShoppingCart_aspx.htm">ShoppingCart.aspx</A>).
        <br>
        <br>
        The ID of the product to add to the cart is passed to this page in the query 
        string. For example, if the user wants to add the "Mighty, Mighty Pen" to the 
        shopping cart, the URL to invoke this page would be 
        AddToCart.aspx?productID=371). Please review the referring pages to see how 
        this argument is added when constructing the hyperlink to this page.
        <br>
        <br>
        The ProductsList page logic is encapsulated entirely within its&nbsp;<strong>Page_Load</strong>&nbsp;event 
        handler.&nbsp; This event handler is called when the page is accessed by a 
        browser client.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Page_Load Event Handler:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Page_Load event 
        handler obtains the specified ProductID parameter using the&nbsp;<strong>Params</strong>&nbsp;collection 
        of the page's&nbsp;<strong>Request</strong>&nbsp;object.&nbsp; The Params 
        collection contains all query string, form field, cookie, and server variables 
        sent from a client during an HTTP request. This the typical API through which 
        page developers access arguments when doing page to page navigation transfers.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Page_Load event handler creates an instance of the ShoppingCartDB class and 
        calls its GetShoppingCartId method to get a "cart ID." The cart ID is created 
        either from the user's login name, or if the user has not yet logged in, from a 
        dynamically-generated GUID. If the cart ID is a GUID, the cart is a "temporary 
        shopping cart" that is good for the current session. This temporary cart is 
        automatically converted to a permanent cart when the user logs in and provides 
        their user name and password.
        <br>
        <br>
        To actually add the item to the cart, the handler calls the AddItem method of 
        the ShoppingCartDB class, passing it the cart ID, the product ID, and the 
        quantity 1. Because the AddItem method expects an integer, the product ID, 
        which is a string when passed in the query string, is converted to an integer. 
        The AddItem method internally uses the <A href="ShoppingCartAddItem.htm">ShoppingCartAddItem</A>&nbsp;stored 
        procedure to update the shopping cart in the IBuySpy database.
        <br>
        <br>
        Immediately after the item is added to the shopping cart, the user is 
        redirected to the <A href="ShoppingCart_aspx.htm">ShoppingCart.aspx</A> &nbsp; 
        page. The redirection is done using the Request object's Redirect method, which 
        causes a client-side redirect to the supplied URL. Causing this redirect to 
        occur immediately ensures that customers cannot accidentally re-add items to 
        the cart by clicking the Refresh button in the browser, because the URL will be 
        different after the redirect takes place.
