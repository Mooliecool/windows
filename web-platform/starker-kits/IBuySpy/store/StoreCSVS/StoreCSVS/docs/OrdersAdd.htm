            "OrdersAdd" Stored Procedure
        </h1>
        <b>Description:</b>
        <P>
            This stored procedure first creates a record in the Orders table for the order
            being created.&nbsp; Then, it adds all of the products from the user's shopping
            cart into the OrderDetails table, and then emptys the user's shopping
            cart.&nbsp; It performs all three of these steps in a transaction.&nbsp; This
            ensures that if an error occurs adding an item to the OrderDetails table, there
            will not be an empty order left in the Orders table.&nbsp;
        </P>

        <b>Database Tables Used: </b>
        <P>
            <i>Orders:</i>
        &nbsp;The Orders table contains the header information about all the orders in
        the system (i.e., all items that are actually purchased. Users must check out
        their cart to place an order in the system). When an order is created, an entry
        is made in the Orders table with the CustomerID, OrderDate and ShipDate. Then,
        any information about the products in the order is added to the OrderDetails
        table as discussed below. Note that if no OrderDate or ShipDate is provided,
        the current date is entered as default.

        <P>
            <i>OrderDetails:</i>
        &nbsp;The OrderDetails table contains detailed product information for each
        order in the system. For each product in an order, an entry is made into the
        OrderDetails table containing the ProductID, Quantity and current UnitCost of
        the item. There is a many to one relationship between OrderDetails table and
        the Orders table. Note the primary key in the table is both OrderID and
        ProductID (since those two columns are the minimum required to guarantee
        uniqueness of a record).

            <i>ShoppingCart:</i>
        &nbsp;The ShoppingCart table keeps track of the items a user has
        purchased.&nbsp; Its primary key is the RecordID field.&nbsp; The CartID is a
        string which we use to identify the user currently logged in.&nbsp; There is a
        many to one relationship between the ShoppingCart table and the Products
        table.&nbsp; Note that if not Quantity is supplied, a default of 1 is entered.
