        <pre>

    CREATE Procedure OrdersList

        @CustomerID int
    )

    SELECT

        <P>
            <i>Orders:</i>
        &nbsp;The Orders table contains the header information about all the orders in
        the system (i.e., all items that are actually purchased. Users must check out
        their cart to place an order in the system). When an order is created, an entry
        is made in the Orders table with the CustomerID, OrderDate and ShipDate. Then,
        any information about the products in the order is added to the OrderDetails
        table as discussed below. Note that if no OrderDate or ShipDate is provided,
        the current date is entered as default.

        <P>
            <i>OrderDetails:</i>
        &nbsp;The OrderDetails table contains detailed product information for each
        order in the system. For each product in an order, an entry is made into the
        OrderDetails table containing the ProductID, Quantity and current UnitCost of
        the item. There is a many to one relationship between OrderDetails table and
        the Orders table. Note the primary key in the table is both OrderID and
        ProductID (since those two columns are the minimum required to guarantee
        uniqueness of a record).
