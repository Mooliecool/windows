            ProductDetails.aspx Page
        </h1>
        <P>
            <b>Description:&nbsp;</b>The ProductDetails page displays detailed information 
            about a particular product.
        </P>
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation Notes:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;This page appears when a 
            user clicks&nbsp;a link to a specific product in the ProductsList.aspx 
            page.&nbsp; The ProductID of the product to display is passed to the page as a 
            URL querystring argument (ie: "ProductDetails.aspx?ProductID=363").&nbsp; 
            Please review the <A href="ProductsList_aspx.htm">ProductsList.aspx</A>
        &nbsp; page to see how this argument is added when constructing the hyperlink 
        to this page.
        <p>
            The ProductsList page logic is encapsulated entirely within its&nbsp;<strong>Page_Load</strong>
        &nbsp;event handler.&nbsp; This event handler is called when the page is 
        accessed by a browser client.&nbsp;
        <p>
            <strong>Page_Load Event Handler:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Page_Load event 
            handler obtains the specified ProductID parameter using the&nbsp;<strong>Params</strong>&nbsp;collection 
            of the page's&nbsp;<strong>Request</strong>
        &nbsp;object.&nbsp; The Params collection contains all query string, form 
        field, cookie, and server variables sent from a client during an HTTP request. 
        This the typical API through which page developers access arguments when doing 
        page to page navigation transfers.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            After converting the ProductID into an Integer, the Page_Load event handler 
            creates an instance of the ProductDB class and calls its GetProductDetails 
            method, passing it the product ID. This method internally uses the <A href="ProductDetail.htm">
                ProductDetail</A> &nbsp;stored procedure to fetch the 
            product&nbsp;information from the IBuySpy database.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the product data is fetched from the database, it is pushed into a number 
            of server controls on the page.&nbsp; Most of these server controls are 
            standard ASP.NET ones (labels, images, hyperlinks, etc).&nbsp; Two of the 
            server controls, however, are custom IBuySpy user controls that we have written 
            to encapsulate the " <A href="_ReviewList_ascx.htm">Review List</A> "&nbsp;of a 
            product, as well as a list of products that people who bought the current 
            product <A href="_AlsoBought_ascx.htm">Also Bought</A>. Note that these user 
            controls can be programmatically manipulated (property sets/gets, methods 
            called, events sunk and raised) just like any other standard server 
            control.&nbsp; They provide a very nice way to encapsulate and reuse 
            functionality, as well as to cleanly partition work up among multiple 
            developers.
        </p>
        <P>
            <strong>Add to Cart:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;The third-to-the-last line of 
            code in the Page_Load event handler dynamically constructs&nbsp;an "Add To 
            Cart" link that, when clicked, adds the product to the user's shopping 
            cart.&nbsp; This link references the <A href="AddToCart_aspx.htm">AddToCart.aspx</A>
            &nbsp;page, and passes the ProductID of the product to add as a 
            dynamically-generated querystring argument to the hyperlink.&nbsp;
        </P>
        <p>
            Note that while it is possible to implement this functionality as an 
            ImageButton that posts back to the ProductsList.aspx page, we choose to 
            implement it this way for the following reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <u>Better reuse of the AddToCart logic</u>.&nbsp; IBuySpy lets the user add 
                products to his cart from the ProductsList.aspx, ProductDetails.aspx and 
                SearchResults.aspx pages.&nbsp; These pages share the logic in the AddToCart 
                page.
                <li>
                    <u>Better use of the Output Cache</u>.&nbsp; If each "AddToCart" link posted 
                    back to it's respective page,&nbsp;there would be many more output cache 
                    entries for the page -- one for each unique querystring value.
                </li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            <b>Peformance Notes:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We output cache the results of this page in order to maximize its 
                    performance.&nbsp; This is accomplished by adding an OutputCache directive at 
                    the top of the page.&nbsp; In this case we elected to output cache the page for 
                    a duration of 1 minute (60 seconds).&nbsp; ASP.NET will automatically store 
                    a separate cache entry for each different querystring value -- and will 
                    automatically render the appropriate output for subsequent requests.
                    <pre>
                    
        &lt;%@ OutputCache Duration="60" VaryByParam="ProductID" %&gt;
                    </pre>
            </ul>
