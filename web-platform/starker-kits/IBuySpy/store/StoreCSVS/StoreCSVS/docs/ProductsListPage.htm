            ProductsList.aspx Page
        </h1>
        <b>Description:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;The ProductsList page displays a list of 
        products in the selected product category
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Implementation Notes:&nbsp;</b> &nbsp;This page appears when a user 
        clicks&nbsp;one of the product category&nbsp;links in the menu that appears on 
        the left side of most pages in IBuySpy. The link is not actually part of the 
        page; instead it is part of the Menu user control ( <A href="_menu_ascx.htm">_Menu.ascx</A>
        ) that is incorporated into the page.
        <br>
        <br>
        When users click a product category, the user control calls the 
        ProductsList.aspx page.&nbsp; The ID of the&nbsp;category to display&nbsp;is 
        passed to this page in the query string. For example, if the user browse items 
        in the Deception category, the URL to display this page would be 
        ProductsList.aspx?categoryID=15).
        <br>
        <br>
        The ProductsList page logic is encapsulated entirely within its&nbsp;<b>Page_Load</b>&nbsp;event 
        handler.&nbsp; This event handler is called when the page is accessed by a 
        browser client.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Page_Load Event Handler:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;The Page_Load event handler obtains 
        the specified CategoryID parameter using the&nbsp;<b>Params</b>&nbsp;collection 
        of the page's&nbsp;<b>Request</b> &nbsp;object.&nbsp; The Params collection 
        contains all query string, form field, cookie, and server variables sent from a 
        client during an HTTP request. This the typical API through which page 
        developers access arguments when doing page to page navigation transfers.
        <br>
        <br>
        After converting the CategoryID into an Integer, the Page_Load event handler 
        creates an instance of the ProductDB class and calls its GetProducts method, 
        passing it the product ID. This method internally uses the <A href="ProductsByCategory.htm">
            ProductsByCategory</A>&nbsp;stored procedure to fetch the 
        product&nbsp;information from the IBuySpy database.
        <br>
        <br>
        The product collection is displayed using a templated &lt;asp:DataList&gt; 
        server control.&nbsp; The DataList server control contains a user-defined&nbsp;<b>ItemTemplate</b>&nbsp;that 
        describes what each item in the list should look like.&nbsp; The data values 
        returned from the ProductsDB.GetProducts() method are populated into the 
        DataList by setting its Datasource property, and then calling its&nbsp;<b>DataBind()</b>
        &nbsp;method.&nbsp; When DataBind() is called, the DataList will iterate over 
        the DataSource and render a copy of the ItemTemplate for each row, populating 
        it data from the row.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Add to Cart:&nbsp;</b> &nbsp;Within the DataList's ItemTemplate, we have 
        implemented an "Add To Cart" link that, when clicked, adds the product item to 
        the user's shopping cart.&nbsp; This link references the <A href="AddToCart_aspx.htm">
            AddToCart.aspx</A> &nbsp;page, and passes the ProductID of the product to 
        add as a dynamically-generated querystring argument to the hyperlink.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>
        Note that while it is possible to implement this functionality as an 
        ImageButton that posts back to the ProductsList.aspx page, we choose to 
        implement it this way for the following reasons:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <u>Better reuse of the AddToCart logic</u>.&nbsp; IBuySpy lets the user add 
            products to his cart from the ProductsList.aspx, ProductDetails.aspx and 
            SearchResults.aspx pages.&nbsp; These pages share the logic in the AddToCart 
            page.
            <li>
                <u>Better use of the Output Cache</u>.&nbsp; If each "AddToCart" link posted 
                back to it's respective page,&nbsp;there would be many more output cache 
                entries for the page -- one for each unique querystring value.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <b>Peformance Notes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We output cache the results of this page in order to maximize its 
                performance.&nbsp; This is accomplished by adding an OutputCache directive at 
                the top of the page.&nbsp; In this case we elected to output cache the page for 
                a duration of 100 minutes (6000 seconds).&nbsp; ASP.NET will automatically store a 
                separate cache entry for each different querystring value -- and will 
                automatically renderthe appropriate output for subsequent requests.
                <pre>
                    
    &lt;%@ OutputCache Duration="6000" VaryByParam="CategoryID" %&gt;
                    </pre>
        </ul>
