            Register.aspx Page
        </h1>
        <p><b>Description:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Register.aspx page enables users browsing 
        IBuySpy to register as a customer.
        <p>
            <b>Implementation Notes:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Register page logic is 
            encapsulated entirely within its&nbsp;<strong>RegisterBtn_Click</strong>
        &nbsp;event handler.&nbsp; This event handler is called on the server when a 
        user clicks the Submit ImageButton on the client.&nbsp;
        <p>
            <strong>RegisterBtn_Click Event Handler:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;This event 
            handler uses the AddCustomer method of the CustomersDB class to add a new 
            customer into the IBuySpy database.&nbsp; This method internally uses the <A href="CustomerAdd.htm">
                CustomerAdd</A>
        &nbsp;stored procedure to insert a new customer record into the IBuySpy 
        database.
        <p>
            After the new customer record is added, the RegisterBtn_Click event handler 
            performs four important actions:
            <ol>
                <LI>
                    <div>
                        It migrates any items stored within a browser's temporary shopping cart into a 
                        permanent shopping cart that is keyed off of the customer's new unique 
                        CustomerID.&nbsp; This ensures that the shopping cart items are not lost if the 
                        customer's browser crashes.&nbsp; It also enables customers to suspend their 
                        shopping experience -- closing their browser or powering off their 
                        machine&nbsp; --&nbsp;then resume it days later, or on another machine.&nbsp;
                    </div>
                <LI>
                    <div>
                        It sends a custom "IBuySpy_FullName" personalization cookie to the client that 
                        contains the full user name of the newly registered user.&nbsp; The home page 
                        of the IBuySpy application -- <A href="default_aspx.htm">Default.aspx</A>&nbsp;-- 
                        will look for this cookie to optionally personalize a welcome message for the 
                        user the next time they visit the page.
                    </div>
                <LI>
                    <div>
                        It invokes the<strong>SetAuthCookie()</strong>static method on the 
                        CookieAuthentication class.&nbsp; This built-in ASP.NET method issues a 
                        MAC-encrypted cookie authentication ticket to the browser client that 
                        identifies their authenticated username&nbsp;of the customer.&nbsp; In IBuySpy, 
                        we use the CustomerID value returned from the CustomersDB.Login method as the 
                        username identity of the client.&nbsp; This is passed as the first argument to 
                        the SetAuthCookie() method.&nbsp;&nbsp;On subsequent&nbsp;requests to the 
                        application we are able to&nbsp;gain access to the CustomerID user 
                        token&nbsp;through the built-in&nbsp;<strong>User.Identity.Name</strong>&nbsp;property 
                        of the ASP.NET page.&nbsp;
                    </div>
                <LI>
                    <DIV>
                        It redirect the browser to the <A href="ShoppingCart_aspx.htm">ShoppingCart.aspx</A>&nbsp;page 
                        -- where they can then optionally proceed on to checkout and purchase items 
                        stored within their shopping cart.
                    </DIV>
                </LI>
            </ol>
        <P>
            <strong>Validating User Input: &nbsp;</strong>The page requires that users 
            enter a name and email address. If you look at the source for the 
            LoginBtn_Click event handler, you'll see that there is no input validation 
            code. Instead, we use the built-in ASP.NET validation controls, which enable 
            you to declaratively specify validation constraints on any input control.
        </P>
        <p>
            ASP.NET comes with built-in validation controls to handle almost any validation 
            requirement: the RequiredField, CompareValidator, RegularExpressionValidator, 
            RangeValidator, and CustomValidator controls. The validation control 
            architecture is extensible, so that other situation-specific controls (ZIP code 
            validators, country code validators, etc) can also be developed by third 
            parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can put a validation control anywhere on a page and declaratively link it 
            to a target input control using the validator's ControlToValidate property. You 
            can optionally specify a Text property that displays in place of the validation 
            control if the input data fails the validation test. If necessary, you can use 
            multiple validators to chain validation logic for a single control (for 
            example, a field is required and must meet a specified pattern).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the page is displayed in a browser that supports EcmaScript 1.2 and the 
            Dynamic HTML (DHTML) 4.0, the validation controls can perform client-side 
            validation, which provides immediate feedback to the user.&nbsp; The validators 
            also perform their check in server code, so if the browser does not support 
            DHMTL, or if client-side scripting is disabled, the validation check is still 
            performed. No code changes are required to enable either scenario -- all logic 
            required to handle the checks on both basic and DHTML-compatible browsers is 
            built into the controls themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are using validation controls, your server code&nbsp;can determine 
            whether the user's input passed the check by testing the IsValid property of 
            the validation control. Additionally, you can check the page's IsValid 
            property; this property is an aggregate of the IsValid properties of all the 
            validators on the page. If any one validation has detected a failure, the 
            page's IsValid property is set to false.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's how the&nbsp;Register page works. Only if all controls on the page are 
            valid will we go ahead and add the new customer. If one of the input fields is 
            invalid, then the page will simply be redisplayed again, with the validation 
            controls automatically taking care of displaying the appropriate error message 
            to the user.
