            ReviewAdd.aspx
        </h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Page Description: &nbsp;</strong>The ReviewAdd page enables customers 
            to enter their own review of a product.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation Notes:</strong> &nbsp;This page appears when a user 
            clicks the "Review this Product" image link on a product detail page ( <A href="ProductDetails_aspx.htm">
                ProductsDetails.aspx </A>). The link is not actually part of the product 
            detail page. Instead, it is part of the ReviewList user control ( <A href="_ReviewList_ascx.htm">
                _ReviewList.ascx </A>
        ) that is incorporated into the page.
        <p>
            When users click the "Review this Product" link, the user control calls the 
            ReviewAdd.aspx page.&nbsp; The ID of the product to review is passed to this 
            page in the query string. For example, if the user wants to add a review of the 
            "Mighty, Mighty Pen," the URL to display this page would be 
            ReviewAdd.aspx?productID= 371).
        </p>
        <p>
        The page logic is encapsulated in two event handlers, the Page_Load event 
        handler and an event handler for the Click event of an ImageButton control.
        <p>
        <p>
            <strong>Page_Load Event Handler:</strong>&nbsp;The Page_Load event handler 
            obtains the specified ProductID parameter using the&nbsp;<strong>Params</strong>&nbsp;collection 
            of the page's&nbsp;<strong>Request</strong>&nbsp;object.&nbsp; The Params 
            collection contains all query string, form field, cookie, and server variables 
            sent from a client during an HTTP request. This the typical API through which 
            page developers access arguments when doing page to page navigation transfers.
        </p>
        <p>
            After converting the ProductID into an Integer, the Page_Load event handler 
            creates an instance of the ProductDB class and calls its GetProductDetails 
            method, passing it the product ID. This method internally uses the <A href="ProductDetail.htm">
                ProductDetail</A> stored procedure to fetch the ModelName field of the 
            product.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code in the Page_Load event handler is wrapped in a conditional code block 
            that only executes if&nbsp;<strong>Page.IsPostBack</strong> &nbsp; is false. 
            This check determines whether the page is being accessed for the first time or 
            whether it is being displayed because the user clicked the Submit button (which 
            causes the page to <em>"post back" </em>to the server). The Page.IsPostBack 
            property provides us with an easy way to ensure the page only fetches product 
            information the first time the page is being displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ReviewAddBtn_Click Event Handler: &nbsp;</strong>The ReviewAddBtn_Click 
            event handler&nbsp;is raised&nbsp;only when a user clicks the submit image 
            button on the page. This handler illustrates an important feature of ASP.NET 
            pages and server controls: although the click actually occurs in the browser, 
            the handler runs on the server, after the page has been posted back.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the logic required to transmit the Click event information from the browser 
            to the server, and there to find and execute the correct method, is all built 
            into the page and control framework. No client-side script, ActiveX controls, 
            Java applets, or any other special processing is required to make this happen. 
            It works with all browsers, including Internet Explorer, Netscape, and Opera.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ReviewAddBtn_Click event handler calls the AddReview method of the 
            ReviewsDB class, which in turn calls the <A href="ReviewsAdd.htm">ReviewsAdd</A>
            stored procedure to save the user's review in the IBuySpy database. All values 
            are HTML encoded before the method is called. This provides protection against 
            a common hacker technique, which is to embed image and anchor links within 
            posted text values that, when later rendered on a page, end up displaying 
            remote images (with pass through links) on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a name="validate"></a><strong>Validating User Input: &nbsp;</strong>The page 
            requires that users enter a name and email address. If you look at the source 
            for the ReviewAdd page, you'll see that there is no input validation code. 
            Instead, we use the built-in ASP.NET validation controls, which enable you to 
            declaratively specify validation constraints on any input control.
        </p>
        <p>
            ASP.NET comes with built-in validation controls to handle almost any validation 
            requirement: the RequiredField, CompareValidator, RegularExpressionValidator, 
            RangeValidator, and CustomValidator controls. The validation control 
            architecture is extensible, so that other situation-specific controls (ZIP code 
            validators, country code validators, etc) can also be developed by third 
            parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can put a validation control anywhere on a page and declaratively link it 
            to a target input control using the validator's ControlToValidate property. You 
            can optionally specify a Text property that displays in place of the validation 
            control if the input data fails the validation test. If necessary, you can use 
            multiple validators to "chain" validation logic for a single control (for 
            example, a field is required and must meet a specified pattern).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the page is displayed in a browser that supports EcmaScript 1.2 and the 
            Dynamic HTML (DHTML) 4.0, the validation controls can perform client-side 
            validation, which provides immediate feedback to the user.&nbsp; The validators 
            also perform their check in server code, so if the browser does not support 
            DHMTL, or if client-side scripting is disabled, the validation check is still 
            performed. No code changes are required to enable either scenario -- all logic 
            required to handle the checks on both basic and DHTML-compatible browsers is 
            built into the controls themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are using validation controls, your server code&nbsp;can determine 
            whether the user's input passed the check by testing the IsValid property of 
            the validation control. Additionally, you can check the page's IsValid 
            property; this property is an aggregate of the IsValid properties of all the 
            validators on the page. If any one validation has detected a failure, the 
            page's IsValid property is set to false.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's how the ReviewAdd page works. Only if all controls on the page are valid 
            will we go ahead and add the product review. If one of the input fields is 
            invalid, then the page will simply be redisplayed again, with the validation 
            controls automatically taking care of displaying the appropriate error message 
            to the user.
