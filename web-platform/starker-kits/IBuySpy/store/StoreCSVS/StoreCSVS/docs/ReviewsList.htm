        <h1>"ReviewsList" Stored Procedure</h1>

        <b>Description:</b>

        <P>This stored procedure accepts a ProductID and returns a recordset of all reviews
        in the Reviews table for that product.  </P>

        <b>Definition:</b>

        <pre>

    CREATE Procedure ReviewsList
    (
        @ProductID int
    )
    AS

    SELECT
        ReviewID,
        CustomerName,
        Rating,
        Comments

    FROM
        Reviews

    WHERE
        ProductID = @ProductID
        </pre>

        <b>Database Tables Used: </b>

        <P><i>Reviews:</i> &nbsp;The Reviews table has a many to one relationship to the Products table.  The
        Reviews table contains all product reviews written by users.  We decided not to
        create a relationship between CustomerName to the FullName in the Customers
        table to allow for anyone to review a product without logging into the system. 
        The ratings used in our implementation range from 1 to 5 stars.  The actual
        review text is allowed to be as large as 3850 characters.
