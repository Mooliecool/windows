        <P>
            <B>Description:</B>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The SearchResults page displays a list of all products whose names 
        or descriptions match a specified search criteria.&nbsp;
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation Notes:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;This page appears when a 
            user clicks&nbsp;the "search" button that appears at the top of most pages in 
            IBuySpy. The search form itself is not actually part of the page; instead it is 
            part of the Header user control ( <A href="_header_ascx.htm">_Header.ascx</A>
        )&nbsp;that is incorporated into the page.
        <p>
            The ProductsList page logic is encapsulated entirely within its&nbsp;<strong>Page_Load</strong>
        &nbsp;event handler.&nbsp; This event handler is called when the page is 
        accessed by a browser client.&nbsp;
        <P>
            <strong>Page_Load Event Handler:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Page_Load event 
            handler obtains the text clause to search the product database using the&nbsp;<strong>Params</strong>&nbsp;collection 
            of the page's&nbsp;<strong>Request</strong>
        &nbsp;object.&nbsp; The Params collection contains all query string, form 
        field, cookie, and server variables sent from a client during an HTTP request. 
        This the typical API through which page developers access arguments when doing 
        page to page navigation transfers.
        <p>
            After converting the CategoryID into an Integer, the Page_Load event handler 
            creates an instance of the ProductDB class and calls its GetProducts method, 
            passing it the product ID. This method internally uses the <A href="ProductSearch.htm">
                ProductSearch</A>&nbsp;stored procedure to fetch the 
            product&nbsp;information from the IBuySpy database.
        </p>
        <p>
            The product collection is displayed using a templated &lt;asp:DataList&gt; 
            server control.&nbsp; The DataList server control contains a user-defined&nbsp;<strong>ItemTemplate</strong>&nbsp;that 
            describes what each item in the list should look like.&nbsp; The data values 
            returned from the ProductsDB.GetProducts() method are populated into the 
            DataList by setting its Datasource property, and then calling its&nbsp;<strong>DataBind()</strong>
        &nbsp;method.&nbsp; When DataBind() is called, the DataList will iterate over 
        the DataSource and render a copy ofthe ItemTemplate for each row, populating it 
        data from the row.&nbsp;&nbsp;
