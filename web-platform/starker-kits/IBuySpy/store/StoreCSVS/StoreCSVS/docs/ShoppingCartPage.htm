            ShoppingCart.aspx Page
        </h1>
        <b>Description:</b> &nbsp;The ShoppingCart.aspx page enables customers to view 
        the current state of their shopping cart. They can also change quantities and 
        remove items.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Implementation Notes</b>:&nbsp; To change quantities, users change the value 
        in a text box, and then click the "Update Your Shopping Cart" button. If they 
        are finished shopping, they can click the "Final Check Out" button.
        <br>
        <br>
        The logic for this page is encapsulated in three event handlers: Page_Load 
        event, the UpdateBtn_Click event handler for the Update button, and the 
        CheckoutBtn_Click event handler for the Checkout button. The page includes some 
        internal methods used to maintain the shopping cart information.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Displaying Current Items:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;Shopping cart 
        information is maintained in the IBuySpy database. When users add items to 
        their cart, the application is actually writing records to the database. In 
        order to keep track of which items belong to which cart, the application tags 
        each record with a "cart ID," which is created in the ShoppingCartDB class 
        either from the user's login name, or if the user has not yet logged in, from a 
        dynamically-generated GUID.
        <br>
        <br>
        When the ShoppingCart.aspx page is first displayed, the&nbsp;<b>Page_Load</b>&nbsp; 
        event handler calls the internal&nbsp;<b>PopulateShoppingCartList</b>&nbsp;method 
        to populate the shopping cart. That method first checks that there are items in 
        the cart. If not, an error is displayed by setting the text of a&nbsp;<b>Label</b>&nbsp;control.
        <br>
        <br>
        The shopping cart items are displayed in a&nbsp;<b>DataGrid</b>&nbsp;control, 
        which includes built-in support for headers and footers, embedded controls in a 
        column, alternating item display (the gray bar), and data binding.
        <br>
        <br>
        The PopulateShoppingCartList method obtains a collection of all items in the 
        user's shopping cart by calling the GetItems method of the ShoppingCartDB 
        class. The GetItems method in turn uses the <A href="ShoppingCartList.htm">ShoppingCartList</A>&nbsp; 
        stored procedure to retrieve the items from the database.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the collection of items is retrieved, it is bound to the&nbsp;<b>DataGrid</b>&nbsp; 
        control by setting the control's&nbsp;<b>DataSource</b>&nbsp;property. Data is 
        copied from the collection to the grid by calling the grid's&nbsp;<b>DataBind</b>&nbsp; 
        method, which causes grid to loop through the data source generate a row for 
        each item. The layout of each item is determined by a set of individual column 
        definitions in the DataGrid control.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Updating Item Information:&nbsp;</strong>When users click the "Update 
        Your Shopping Cart" button, it invokes the <strong>UpdateBtn_Click</strong> event 
        handler, which in turn calls the internal UpdateShoppingCartDatabase method to 
        write the shopping cart items back into the database. After the update, the 
        handler calls the same PopulateShoppingCartList method used when the page is 
        first displayed in order to refresh the shopping cart grid on the page. The 
        update is performed by looping through the Items collection of the DataGrid 
        control. Each item corresponds logically to a row in the grid. To get the value 
        of an individual control in an item, the process calls the Items collection's 
        FindControl method, which is a shorthand way to locate a control that might be 
        in any column. For each item, the update process determines whether to remove 
        or update that item in the shopping cart.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Checking Out:&nbsp;</strong>If the user clicks the "Final Check Out" 
        button, it invokes the <strong>CheckoutBtn_Click</strong> event handler. The 
        handler performs an update of the cart to make sure the database is current and 
        then redirects the client to the Checkout.aspx page.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Performance Notes:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible optimization would be 
        to store the original (pre-update) quantity value of each row in a hidden field 
        of the grid. Doing so would enable us to determine if the Quantity text box 
        value had changed, and would allow us to call the UpdateItem method of the 
        ShoppingCartDB class only if the quantity value of that specific row had 
        actually changed. As currently implemented, the page updates every item and 
        refreshes the grid each time the user clicks the "Update Your Shopping Cart" 
        button, even if there is no change.
