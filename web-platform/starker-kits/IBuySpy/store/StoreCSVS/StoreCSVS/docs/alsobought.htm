        AlsoBought User Control

        <P>
            <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The AlsoBought user control displays a list of the 5 other products most
        often purchased by customers who also purchased a specified product.&nbsp;

        </P>
        <P>
            <strong>Implementation Notes:&nbsp;</strong>
            &nbsp;The AlsoBought control is used in the
            <A href="productdetails_aspx.htm">
            ProductDetails.aspx</A>&nbsp;page.
        <p>
        The AlsoBought user control exposes a single public field -- ProductID -- at
        the top of the file.&nbsp; This enables consumers of the AlsoBought user
        control (like the ProductDetails.aspx page) to set the ProductID of the
        AlsoBought product either programmatically or declaratively (via a tag
        attribute).&nbsp; Note that only those fields, properties and methods that have
        a public accessor declaration can be externally accessed in this way.&nbsp; For
        example, the Page_Load event handler does not have a public accessor keyword
        before it, and therefore can not be called from the ProductDetails.aspx page.
        <p>
            The AlsoBought user control logic is encapsulated entirely within its&nbsp;<strong>Page_Load</strong>&nbsp;event handler.&nbsp; This event handler is called when a page containing
        the user control is accessed by a browser client.&nbsp;
        <P>
            <strong>Page_Load Event Handler:&nbsp;</strong>
            &nbsp;The Page_Load event handler creates an instance of the ProductDB class
            and calls its GetProductsAlsoPurchased method, passing it the product ID. This
            method internally uses the
            <A href="CustomerAlsoBought.htm">
            CustomerAlsoBought</A>
        &nbsp;stored procedure to fetch the product&nbsp;information from the IBuySpy database.&nbsp;
        <p>
        The product collection is displayed using a templated &lt;asp:Repeater&gt;
        server control.&nbsp; As used in this user control, the Repeater server control
        contains three user-defined templates -- HeaderTemplate, ItemTemplate and
        FooterTemplate -- that describe how the list should look.&nbsp; The
        ItemTemplate defines how the bound data is displayed; the HeaderTemplate
        defines HTML that is emitted at the beginning of the list;&nbsp;and the
        FooterTemplate defines HTML that is emitted at the end of the list.
        <P>
            The data values returned from the ProductsDB.GetProductsAlsoPurchased() method are populated into the Repeater by setting its Datasource property, and then calling its&nbsp;<strong>DataBind()</strong>&nbsp;method.&nbsp; When DataBind() is called, the Repeater will render its
        HeaderTemplate, then iterate over the DataSource and render a copy of the
        ItemTemplate for each row, populating it data from the row.&nbsp;
        Finally,&nbsp;the Repeater&nbsp;will render its FooterTemplate.&nbsp;
        <P>
            <B>Peformance Notes:</B>
            <UL>
                <LI>
                    Unlike the
                    <A href="_popularitems_ascx.htm">
                    PopularItems</A>
                    &nbsp;user control, whose purpose and logic&nbsp;are very similar, the
                    AlsoBought user control does not cache the results of the
                    ProductsDB.GetProductsAlsoPurchased() method.&nbsp; This is because the
                    AlsoBought user control is currently only used from the
                    <A href="productdetails_aspx.htm">
                    ProductDetails.aspx</A>
                &nbsp;page, which itself uses output caching.&nbsp; As such, the results
                generated by the AlsoBought user control are already cached by the containing page.
