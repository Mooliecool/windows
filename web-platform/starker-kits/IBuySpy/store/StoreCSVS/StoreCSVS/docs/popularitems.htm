            PopularItems User Control
        </h1>
        <P>
            <b>Description:&nbsp;</b>The PopularItems user control displays a list of the 
            top 5 most popular items purchased from IBuySpy, and enables users to easily 
            navigate off to read details about each one.

            <A href="UserControls.htm"><STRONG>Click here to learn more about what user controls 
                    are and how they are used within ASP.NET Web Applications</STRONG></A>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation Notes:&nbsp;</strong>
        &nbsp;This control is used on the IBuySpy application home page.
        <p>
            The PopularItems user control logic is encapsulated entirely within its&nbsp;<strong>Page_Load</strong>
        &nbsp;event handler.&nbsp; This event handler is called when a page containing 
        the user control is accessed by a browser client.&nbsp;
        <p>
            <strong>Page_Load Event Handler:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;The Page_Load event 
            handler creates an instance of the ProductDB class and calls its 
            GetMostPopularProductsOfWeek method, passing it the product ID. This method 
            internally uses the <a href="ProductsMostPopular.htm">ProductsMostPopular</a>
        stored procedure to fetch the product&nbsp;information from the IBuySpy 
        database.&nbsp;
        <p>
        The product collection is displayed using a templated &lt;asp:Repeater&gt; 
        server control.&nbsp; As used in this user control, the Repeater server control 
        contains three user-defined templates -- HeaderTemplate, ItemTemplate and 
        FooterTemplate -- that describe how the list should look.&nbsp; The 
        ItemTemplate defines how the bound data is displayed; the HeaderTemplate 
        defines HTML that is emitted at the beginning of the list;&nbsp;and the 
        FooterTemplate defines HTML that is emitted at the end of the list.
        <p>
            The data values returned from the ProductsDB.GetMostPopularProductsOfWeek() 
            method are populated into the Repeater by setting its Datasource property, and 
            then calling its&nbsp;<strong>DataBind()</strong>
        &nbsp;method.&nbsp; When DataBind() is called, the Repeater will render its 
        HeaderTemplate, then iterate over the DataSource and render a copy of the 
        ItemTemplate for each row, populating it data from the row.&nbsp; 
        Finally,&nbsp;the Repeater&nbsp;will render its FooterTemplate.&nbsp;
        <p>
            <b>Peformance Notes:&nbsp;</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The PopularItems user control support partial page output caching 
                    (a new ASP.NET Beta2 feature) to outputcache its results at 1 day 
                    intervals. This enables the application to avoid having to read the 
                    database on each request to a page containing this user control 
                    (dramatically improving performance). 
                </li>
            </ul>
