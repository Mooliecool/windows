            ReviewList User Control
        </h1>
        <P>
            <b>Description:</b> The ReviewList user control displays a list of reviews 
            written by customers about a specified product.&nbsp; It is registered and used 
            on the IBuySpy ProductDetails page.&nbsp;
        </P>

            <A href="UserControls.htm"><STRONG>Click here to learn more about what user controls 
                    are and how they are used within ASP.NET Web Applications</STRONG> </A>
        </p>
        <P>
            <STRONG>Implementation Notes: </STRONG>The ReviewList user control logic is 
            encapsulated entirely within its&nbsp;<strong>Page_Load</strong>
        &nbsp;event handler.&nbsp; This event handler is called when a page containing 
        the user control is accessed by a browser client.&nbsp;
        <p>
            <strong>Page_Load Event Handler:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ReviewList user 
            control exposes a single public field -- ProductID -- at the top of the 
            file.&nbsp; This enables consumers of the ReviewList user control -- like the <A href="productdetails_aspx.htm">
                ProductDetails.aspx</A> page -- to either programmatically or declaratively 
            (via a tag attribute) set the ProductID of the product to obtain a review 
            list.&nbsp; Note that only those fields, properties and methods that have a 
            "public" accessor declaration before them can be <EM>externally </EM>
        accessed in this way (for example: the Page_Load event handler does not have a 
        "public" keyword accessor before it -- and as such can not be called from the 
        ProductDetails.aspx page).&nbsp;
        <P>
        The ReviewList's Page_Load event handler utilizes the ProductID argument to 
        invoke the "GetReviews" method of the IBuySpy.ProductsDB class to obtain a 
        collection of reviews by users of the specified product.&nbsp; This method 
        internally uses the "ReviewsList" stored procedure to fetch the review 
        information from the IBuySpy database.
        <P>
        The review collection is displayed using a templated &lt;asp:datalist&gt; 
        server control.&nbsp; The &lt;asp:datalist&gt; server control contains a single 
        user-defined customization templates: an "ItemTemplate" that defines what each 
        item in the list should look like.
        <P>
            The data values returned from the ProductsDB.GetReviews() method are populated 
            into the &lt;asp:datalist&gt; by setting the DataList's "Datasource" property 
            and then calling its "DataBind()" method.&nbsp; The DataList will iterate over 
            every row in the DataSource when the "DataBind()" method is called -- using an 
            ItemTemplate to customize each row's appearance.
        </P>

            <LI>
                The ReviewList user control does not cache the results of the 
                ProductsDB.GetReviews() method.&nbsp; This is because the ReviewList user 
                control is currently only used from the <A href="productdetails_aspx.htm">ProductDetails.aspx</A>
            page -- which itself uses output caching.&nbsp; As such, the results generated 
            by the ReviewList user control are already cached by the containing page.&nbsp; 
            If in the future we choose to use the ReviewList user control on page's that 
            were not output cached, then we would definitely want to insert data caching 
            logic here.&nbsp;
