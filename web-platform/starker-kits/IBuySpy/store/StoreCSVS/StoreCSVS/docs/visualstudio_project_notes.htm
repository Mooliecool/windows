                        <STRONG>Overview.</STRONG>&nbsp; This version of the IBuySpy Portal application 
                        has been packaged as a Visual Studio .NET application, specifically a Visual C# 
                        .NET "ASP.NET Web Application" project.&nbsp; In addition to showing the 
                        IBuySpy Portal application, this sample shows how to implement a real web 
                        application in VS.NET.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        <STRONG>Code-Behind</STRONG>.&nbsp; One of the big benefits of ASP.NET is a 
                        much more complete separation between static content (HTML, text and tags) from 
                        code.&nbsp; There are a couple of different ways to achieve this in 
                        ASP.NET.&nbsp; The SDK versions of IBuySpy show the "single-file" approach, 
                        where code is in the same file as the static content, but segregated into a 
                        single code block.&nbsp;&nbsp;VS.NET, on the other hand, favors ASP.NET's 
                        code-behind model for separating code from content.&nbsp; This way, the 
                        page&nbsp;code is a fully encapsulated class which gets the full benefits of 
                        code editing in VS.NET: syntax color coding, statement completion, 
                        auto-insertion of event handling methods, design-time syntax checking and full 
                        debugging support.
                    </P>

                            <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: It is possible to 
                                create, edit and debug single-file ASPX files in VS.NET, however most of the 
                                features listed above are not supported for <EM>code</EM> within a single-file 
                                ASPX file.&nbsp; To create a single file ASPX, select Project &gt; Add New 
                                Item, and create a new Text file with the .ASPX extension.&nbsp; </FONT>

                    <P>
                        When you create a new ASP.NET page, or "Web Form," VS.NET creates both the 
                        .ASPX file, and the code-behind file.&nbsp; By default the code-behind file is 
                        hidden, but you can see it by selecting Project &gt; <b>Show All Files</b>.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        To work with a Web Form in VS.NET, double-click the file name in Solution 
                        Explorer, or right-click and select one of the available actions.&nbsp; <STRONG>Open</STRONG>
                        will open&nbsp;an ASPX file in design view, and a .CS file in code view.&nbsp; <STRONG>
                            Open With</STRONG> permits you to select a different editor for the file, 
                        for example, Notepad.&nbsp; <STRONG>View Code</STRONG> always opens the 
                        code-behind for the selected file (even when the ASPX file is selected).&nbsp; 
                        Likewise, <STRONG>View Designer </STRONG>always opens the ASPX file.
                    </P>

                        The Web Forms designer also uses the &lt;%@ Page %&gt; directive (or &lt;%@ 
                        Control %&gt; directive for user controls) to associate the two files.&nbsp; 
                        Minimally, code-behind ASP.NET pages and user controls created in VS.NET need 
                        the following attributes:
                    </P>
                    <PRE>        
    &lt;%@ Page Language="c#" AutoEventWireup="false" Codebehind="WebForm1.aspx.cs" Inherits="PortalVS.WebForm1"%&gt;
    
    &lt;%@ Control Language="c#" AutoEventWireup="false" Codebehind="myControl.ascx.cs" Inherits="PortalVS.myControl"%&gt;

                    <UL>

                            <U>AutoEventWireup</U>.&nbsp; This should be false for VS.NET code-behind 
                        pages and user controls.&nbsp; Setting AutoEventWireup to false disables the 
                        automatic Page wireup of page events when a specially named method is found in 
                        the code (for example, Page_Load).&nbsp; VS.NET always creates the page event 
                        wireup explicitly in code.&nbsp;
                        <LI>
                            <U>Codebehind</U>.&nbsp; This is a design-time only attribute used by the 
                        Web Forms designer.&nbsp;
                        <LI>
                            <U>Inherits</U>.&nbsp; This is used at runtime to associate the code in the 
                            code-behind class with the code generated from the ASPX file.

                        <STRONG>Project Properties</STRONG>.&nbsp; In a Visual C# application, the .NET 
                        namespace for the code in the project is&nbsp;provided by the Project 
                        Properties, as is the name of the assembly to build.&nbsp; In this project, the 
                        assembly name is set to "Portal."&nbsp; The Default namespace is not set, which 
                        permits the developer to choose the namespace explicitly on a per-file basis. 
                        &nbsp; To see this, examine Project &gt; Properties.&nbsp;
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Another interesting feature of Project Properties is the ability to specific 
                        Imports statements at the project level.&nbsp; This reduces the code in each 
                        code file by several lines.

                        code-behind class must be compiled prior to running the page.&nbsp; You can

                        will open the page in the default browser within VS.NET.&nbsp; <STRONG>Browse
